### I live to learn, to understand, to internalize, to perfect.

     During the day I currently work as a devops engineer, but I'm still very much at the beginning of my working life. 
     However, the opportunity has arisen for me to move away from Java, Maven and co (Java EE, JSF, Tomcat, SVN, MySQL etc.) 
     to activities ranging from Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Virtulalization, GitOps, Kubernetes, CI/CD to some GO and shell scripting. 
     And all of that is just the beginning.

     I look forward to every challenge that lies ahead.
     At night I spent most of my time on single board computers, primarily Rasperry Pi's.
     I try to work on my own projects or I use already existing repositories and adapt them to my needs. 
     I also learn Python and C++ as good as I can, even if this proves to be difficult in terms of time.
     I am constantly expanding my knowledge in all common operating systems, including Linux (primarily Debian/Ubuntu), MacOS (Unix) and also Windows.

     I attach great importance to security and data protection, both at work and in my private life.
     You realize how tedious even small projects can be, if you want to find a secure solution according to the current standards.
     I want to spread awareness for security and privacy in all areas of our digital everyday life.
     I still have a lot to learn and a lot ahead of me, but I'm looking forward to the journey.
     The journey is the destination.
     I'm looking forward to supporting others on my way and maybe even being supported even more.
